# UNet-brain-MRI-segmentation
Using U-Net model to do segmentation on brain magnetic resonance (MR) images

This is one of the projects we did in the course COMP3710 Pattern Analysis and Recognision in Uuniversity of Qeensland.

The purpose of this project is to build a U-Net model to do a segmentation on brain MRI. The set of data is taken from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). It is a set of brain MRI consisted of 4 different shades of black. The U-Net model then learns from the preporcessed segementation and perform an automatic segementation for a given brain MRI.
